                   <h3>The Shorties</h3>
                   <p>The rich man had two sons. The first son was hard working. He always obeyed his Father. He was a very good and nice person. But, the second son was totally different from the first son. He was lazy. He did not work in his Father's field. He was disobedient to his Father. He wanted to lead a free and happy life with no work. </p>

                   <p>One day, the younger son said to his father. “Father, give me my share of property." The father felt very sad. He divided the property. The second son took his share of property.</p>

                   <p>The youngest son left home with his share. He went out of town to Las Vegas, Nevada. There he made a lot of friends. He spent his coins lavishly on his friends, foods and drinks. He had many bad habits too.</p>

                   <h7>The "Aha!" Moment</h7>
                   <p>AT that time, there was a famine in that land. He could not get any job. None of his friends gave him food or money. He was forced to take up a very mean job. His job was to feed the pigs. Very often he ate the food kept for the pigs. He was very sad about his present conditions. He soon began to think of his father and his brother. He said to himself, “In my father’s house, even the servants have enough food. They get good shelter too. But here, I am struggling for food and shelter. I will go back to my father. I will beg him to take me as his servant."</p>

                   <h8>The Wait</h8>
                   <p>So decided, the prodigal son set out for his father’s house. In the meantime, his father was always thinking of his second son. He would sit near the windows. He would look out at the road, expecting his son to return home.</p>

                   <h9>Welcome Back</h9>
                   <p>One day his father saw his son coming at a distance. He ran out of his house in great joy. He met his son on the way. His son knelt down. He said, “Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant. "His father lifted his lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, “Bring the best fur coat. Put it on my son. Put a ring and gold chain on his neck and fingers and Jordans on his feet. Kill the fatted calf. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and party. My son was lost. Now he is found."</p>

                   <h10>Jealousy in the Camp</h10>
                   <p>The elder son was returning from his work. He heard the sound of the music and dancing from his house. He asked one of his servants about it. His servant told his, “Your brother has come. Your father is rejoicing at his return. A fatted calf has been killed to prepare for a delicious feast and the celebration. "The first son was angry. He refused to enter his house. The father came out. He begged his elder son to come in for rejoicing. The elder son said, “I have obeyed you all these years. I have done all your works. But you never gave me even a kid to enjoy with my friends. This son wasted all your money and property. And you order a fatted calf for him! "His father replied, “My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"</p>
